# 🎓 VR Classroom – AI-Powered Immersive Learning Environment

A 3D virtual classroom experience built in Unity, designed to simulate real-world teaching and learning — enhanced by AI tools, intelligent virtual spaces, and an interactive environment.

This project was created as part of the **Imagine Cup Ideathon** with a mission to make digital learning more **engaging**, **immersive**, and **intelligent**, without the need for physical infrastructure or VR hardware.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional online education platforms often fail to provide the engaging, immersive experience that in-person classrooms offer. Students lack spatial presence, interactive tools, and natural communication — leading to disengagement and reduced learning outcomes.

---

## ✅ Solution

We built a **single-user 3D virtual classroom** environment in Unity, which allows users to explore, interact, and learn in a fully immersive digital space — powered by AI tools and designed for flexibility.
